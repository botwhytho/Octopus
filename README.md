# Octopus
A voice-controlled game made by myself and [Louise](https://github.com/LouiseBC) for the Recurse Center Game Jam. The aim is to deliver as many recurse center computers from one end of the screen to the other, while avoiding hostile sea-dwellers.

Controls: left/right keys or a/d are used for lateral movement, movement on the y-axis is volume-controlled.
